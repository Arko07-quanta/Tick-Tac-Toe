# Tick-Tac-Toe
Hello World! I am Arko. 
I am a student of class 10 learning code and started learning code with python

This is my first repository. I have created a tictactoe game with python.
In this game you can play tictactoe game with computer for some refreshment
when you are bored. The board is indexed from 1-9. The values of the first 
row are 1,2,3 from left to right and 4-6 in the second row in a similar way.
To make your move you just need to type in the index.

The prequisites to play this game are, you need to have python installed in
your native device.
Dowload the zip from this repository and open the .py file in your python IDE.
And you are good to go.


Also special thanks to Ahammad Shawki who has helped me to find errors and modify

this game. Have a good day!
